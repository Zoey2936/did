# What is this?

This project is preconfigured to allow to collect all public GitHub data about a specific user in order to use it in a work report.

## How to use this?

1. Fork this project
2. Adjust the email and login value in the did.config file to match your GitHub username and commit to your main branch
3. Make sure to enable the workflow by navigating to the `Actions` tab of your Fork and pressing the green `Enable workflows ...` button.
4. Then a workflow should run every week and fail by design in order to generate a notification where you can find what you did last week
